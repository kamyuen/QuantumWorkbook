# A Quantum Playbook

This package contains two compilations of Mathematica(R) demonstrations. The first, Workbook Demonstrations, includes all demonstrations in ["A Quantum Computation Workbook" (Springer, March 2022)](https://link.springer.com/book/9783030912130). The other, Playbook Demonstrations, is a collection of demonstrations of various topics in the field of *quantum information systems*, *quatum many-body systems*, and *quantum spin systems*. Users can try and modify the code themselves to build their own examples on the demonstrations and to experiment their fresh ideas.

The code in this package is based on Mathematica package [Q3](https://github.com/quantum-mob/Q3). [Q3](https://github.com/quantum-mob/Q3) consists of tools and utilities that perform symbolic calculations and numerical simulations useful in the study of quantum information processing, quantum many-body systems, and quantum spin systems. With [Q3](https://github.com/quantum-mob/Q3), one can avoid many of the tedious calculations involved in various principles and theorems of quantum theory. Furthermore, numerous visualization and simulation tools can help deepen the understanding of core concepts.

## Playbook Demonstrations

Here is another compilation of demonstrations that have not been covered in detail or at all in ["A Quantum Computation Workbook" (Springer, March 2022)](https://link.springer.com/book/9783030912130). This includes a wide range of topics from the field of quantum information systems, quantum many-body systems, and quantum spin systems.

- Partial Trace: Physical Meaning
- Non-Unitary Dynamics of Quantum States
- Transposition as a Supermap
- Addition of Numbers
